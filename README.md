# UE_Replication

This project had for purpose getting familiar with server/client replication on a dedicated LAN server, on Unreal Engine 5.
It was done at Isart Digital in november 2023 for 3 week.
It was realised by two programmers: me and [Emma Masseteau](https://github.com/Elmea).

The exercise involved in the creation of a dedicated server, the management of sessions, the creation of a lobby, and obviously, managing the game on the server and the client.

## Set-up Instructions

### Server side
* Clone the project.
* In the "StartDedicatedServer.bat", make sure you the right path to "UnrealEditor.exe".
* Run the ".bat".


### Client side
Two solution:
* Go to realese and download the shipped project.
  * Then, run the ".exe" file.
  *  Enjoy.
* Same thing as for the server: make sure you the right path to "UnrealEditor.exe" in the "StartClient.bat".
  * Run the ".bat".
  * Enjoy.
