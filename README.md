# UE_Replication

This project had for purpose getting familiar with server/client replication on a dedicated LAN server, on Unreal Engine 5.
It was done at Isart Digital in november 2023 for 3 week.
It was realised by two programmers: me and [Emma Masseteau](https://github.com/Elmea).

The exercise involved in the creation of a dedicated server, the management of sessions, the creation of a lobby, and obviously, managing the game on the server and the client.
